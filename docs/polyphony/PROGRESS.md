# Polyphony — iteration log

Append-only. One `Iter NN` entry per loop iteration, mirroring the atlas log. Tracks the
walk from Phase 0 (inventory) to a validated, tournament-converged, synergy-positive ensemble.

## Definition of Done (the convergence criterion)

The loop completes when **both** hold, across all covered domains:

- **Competition converged** — a stable champion (feature set + couplings + routed models) that
  **no** challenger feature, coupling, method, or **red-team** attack can beat within a full
  tournament round on real data.
- **Synergy-positive** — the coupled ensemble **out-predicts the sum of isolated parts** on real
  historical data (net positive synergy), or every retained coupling is individually
  synergy-justified and non-synergistic ones are cut.

Plus the standing invariants (every commit): `mkdocs build --strict` green · `graph.json` valid &
0-dangling · Polyphony package typed with tests green · positioning honesty preserved (no
"world model" claims).

## Phase gates

- **P0** Scout, Inventory & Position · **P1** Blueprint & Wireframes · **P2** Scaffold (vertical
  slice) · **P3** Research & compete · **P4** Validate & attack · **P5+** Scale to full validation.

## Log

- **Iter 01 — Kickoff + Phase 0 underway.** Established the GitHub collaboration scaffolding and
  the Phase-0 deliverables:
  - **Scaffolding:** `polyphony/` top-level package (README, `pyproject.toml`, `polyphony/__init__.py`);
    root `CONTRIBUTING.md`; `.github/` PR template + 3 issue templates (synergy-hypothesis,
    model-adapter, gap-or-extension); `docs/decisions/` ADR folder (index + template).
  - **ADR-0001** — Positioning: a paradigm-plural ensemble, **not** a world model (bans
    overclaiming language; commits to plurality, disagreement-as-signal, adversarial validation,
    falsifiable synergy, exposed values).
  - **ADR-0002** — Repo layout (code at `polyphony/`, docs at `docs/polyphony/`, ADRs at
    `docs/decisions/`) + autonomous-loop trunk-based flow behind a green gate; keeps
    `mkdocs build --strict` green with no extra plugin.
  - **Phase 0 docs:** `docs/polyphony/index.md`; **`00-inventory.md`** (atlas reduced to
    models/state/paradigm, 11 dials from the comparative matrices incl. the new **values dial**,
    the 16 engines as component blueprints, graph-implied couplings, 4 candidate synergy loops,
    and gaps/new-factor candidates — incl. proposed new engines: data-assimilation, surrogate,
    ensemble/meta, welfare-equity); **`related-work.md`** (positioning vs DestinE, IAMs, ML/LLM
    world models; the 4-part gap Polyphony fills); **`leaderboard.md`** + this **`PROGRESS.md`**.
  - **mkdocs nav:** added *Polyphony* and *Decisions* sections; strict build green.
  - **Next (Iter 02, finish Phase 0 → open Phase 1):** open GitHub gap issues from
    [00-inventory §6](00-inventory.md); then Phase 1 blueprint — the **common model interface**
    (state·step·dials·provenance), the coupling/routing/disagreement + uncertainty-propagation
    design, the **welfare/equity multi-objective dial**, and the **tournament + red-team + synergy
    protocol**, with committed Mermaid diagrams and a tech-stack ADR. First vertical slice target:
    **DICE ⇄ energy (OSeMOSYS/MESSAGEix) ⇄ CGE**.
